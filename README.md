# Seam Programming Language

## Introduction
Seam is an experimental, compiled toy-language created by ![Pelanyo Kamara](https://github.com/MathematicalDessert). It has no specific goal in mind at the moment, but has an internal list of features which are important to the core of the language.

Seam takes inspiration from C++ primarily, and tries to marry it nicely with a language like Rust. This does not mean that it is simply a carbon-copy of either language. As prefaced before, this is simply a toy-language developed as a pass-time activity.

## The Future
It is entirely possible that in the future Seam will be developed more actively, but only time will tell. After the core of the language is developed, an assessment on whether it is worth continuing formally will be taken.

## Contribution
At the moment there is no strict guide on how to contribute to Seam, but any and all help is always welcome. A more comprehensive contribution guide will be written here at some point.
